# Tor-Browser-Standalone
Tor Browser is a web browser fucused in security an privacy (uses TOR network and navigate on the Deep Web\Dark Web). Protect yourself against tracking, surveillance, and censorship. If you are in a country where Tor is blocked, you can configure Tor to connect to a bridge during the setup process. Select "Tor Network Settings" and "Use a bridge". If Tor is not censored, one of the most common reasons Tor won't connect is an incorrect system clock. Please make sure it's set correctly.
