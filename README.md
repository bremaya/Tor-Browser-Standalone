# Tor Browser Standalone

Tor Browser is a web browser fucused in security an privacy (uses TOR network and navigate on the Deep Web\Dark Web). Protect yourself against tracking, surveillance, and censorship. If you are in a country where Tor is blocked, you can configure Tor to connect to a bridge during the setup process. Select "Tor Network Settings" and "Use a bridge". If Tor is not censored, one of the most common reasons Tor won't connect is an incorrect system clock. Please make sure it's set correctly.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Tor Browser Team (https://www.torproject.org) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with Tor Browser v11.0.11 (auto enviromente select 32 or 64 bit).
